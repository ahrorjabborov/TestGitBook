# How Recommendations are Generated

### How Recommendations are Generated

Our recommendation engine uses a blend of data analytics and AI-driven insights to provide personalized advice based on your performance data.

#### How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**\
   Once your video has been processed, our system gathers a variety of performance metrics—from speed and cadence in running to jump height and reactive strength index in jumping, and bar speed and power in weightlifting.
2. **Benchmark Comparison:**\
   These metrics are compared against optimal ranges and historical data from your previous sessions. The system identifies deviations that may indicate areas for improvement.
3. **Rule-Based & AI Analysis:**\
   Our engine uses predefined rules along with machine learning models to analyze the data. For example:
   * **Running:** If your ground contact time is longer than ideal or cadence is low, the system will flag these metrics.
   * **Jumping:** Discrepancies between jump height and flight time or an imbalanced reactive strength index trigger specific feedback.
   * **Weightlifting:** Lower than expected bar speed or high catch times may prompt recommendations on technique adjustments.
4. **Generating the Feedback:**\
   Using generative AI, the system then crafts clear, actionable recommendations. These suggestions are displayed alongside your report, providing context and steps for improvement.
5. **Presentation:**\
   Recommendations are shown in a concise, expandable format. Each recommendation includes a short explanation, supporting data, and often a benchmark or target value to aim for.

#### What to Expect in the Recommendations Section

* **Tailored Advice:**\
  Each recommendation is specific to your current performance. For instance, a runner might receive a suggestion to “Increase your cadence by 5 steps per minute to improve efficiency.”
* **Visual and Textual Feedback:**\
  The feedback appears both as text and, where applicable, within graphical annotations in your reports.
* **Continuous Refinement:**\
  As you log more sessions, our system continuously learns from your data. This means recommendations evolve over time to remain relevant to your progress and training goals.
